  #  - :javascripts -- portlet-specific javascripts that are included at
  #                    the head of master HTML, such as body onload functions (Liferay only)
  #  - :host        -- hostname:port of the deployment server
  #  - :servlet     -- by default, the name of the Rails app (= name of the WAR package)
  #  - :path        -- unless you're using named routes, you can define the path here
